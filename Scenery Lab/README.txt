This is the completed scenery lab. Run normally through the 'javac *.java' and 'java Runner' commands. Before drawing the scene
it will ask the user to choose either day or night and a clear or a cloudy sky. In order to better organize my scenery classes,
I wanted to make a few structs but as java does not support such a type, I had to create 2 additional classes(although these classes
don't require their own file).

Requirements met:
1. Day and Night scenery
2. Cloudy and Not Cloudy
3. Scenery with the 5 objects
    1. Sun/Moon
    2. House
    3. Fence
    4. Trees
    5. Procedurally generated grass through a loop (Challenge)
4. Selection menu
5. Milestone 1 -- checked off
6. Challenge III - Use a loop to draw a field of grass, rain, or a row of trees like a forest.(Loop draws the grass -- counted
as one of the scenery objects)
