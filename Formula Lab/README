Commands to run: javac *.java && java Runner

Runner contains the main loop and the switch statement. The formulas file contains all the formulas. There are
3 formulas that use the pi instance variable and two physics formula that use gravity. You will be able to tell
for which formulas use pi and gravity as long as you have had some algebra experience(circles, cones, anything round will
obviously have used pi) and the two physics formulas are labelled when playing. Entering in 0 quits the game. Entering in anything
aside from 0-15 results in the program asking if you want to continue to play like it does after a completed formula.

Requirements completed:
2 pi formulas
2 physics gravity formulas
